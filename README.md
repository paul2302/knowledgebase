railsApp for basic knowledge base features

In case you want to tell your customers more about your products let it be frequently asked questions or how to use them,
this basic knowledge base module can help you with that. Just navigate to the main page and you will find yourself the option to 
either create a new article or to list all the articles. If you chose to create a new article you have to fill out the question and
the answer. The question has to have a length of 5 or more characters to prevent you from accidentally save a blank or nearly
blank question. If you clicked on all articles you can see all the articles currently s ored in the database. 
You can click on show to see the answer in english as well as german. The app currently requires you to fill out everything in 
english and there will be a feature in the future which will translated both the question and the answer into german.
